Hymenoptera Online (HOL) mobile app for iOS
Build: 1.0 (30-Apr-2013)


description
==============

The Hymenoptera Online (HOL) mobile app from the C.A.Triplehorn Insect Collection (Ohio State University) brings the usefulness of the popular web resource to your iOS device. Designed for taxonomists, field collectors and bug enthusiasts, the HOL app provides information on taxa primarily within the insect order of Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, bees) but also in other insect orders such as Hemiptera (true bugs, leafhoppers, cicadas), Coleoptera (beetles), and Diptera (flies). Also available is an extensive array of taxonomic information on Acari (mites, ticks) from the Ohio State Acarology Lab and many more animal groups already added.

Need to find an article about a fire ant (Solenopsis) that was recently described while you were visiting a collection? Open up the HOL app, search for "Solenopsis", get a list of all the articles that deal with this genus, and view the article right from your iPhone or iPad. You may even save the article to your local HOL library to read the original description of the new species on a flight when you do not have WiFi or cellular access. The enthusiast may also save an article that contains a key to the species of fire ants to provide a real-time identification. With almost 7,000 publications available for download, the paper you're looking for may be at the palm of your hands.

Looking to catch the American pelecinid wasp (Pelecinus polyturator) on "the Cape" in Massachusetts? Use the mapping capabilities on the HOL app to find the distribution of the species, then click on a distribution point to get the locality information. Also, get driving directions to the collecting locality with just a press of your finger by using your current location, the coordinates of the locale, and the Google Maps/Apple Maps app. The app can also find collecting localities near where you stand.

The HOL mobile app also provides access to over 10,000 high resolution specimen images with an interface that mimics the useful and comfortable iOS Photos app. Want to see images of the recently revised scelionid wasp genus Heptascelio? Peruse the images in thumbnails view, or click in image for a full resolution investigation zooming in and on the image with intuitive simplicity.
